When making a **contribution**, make sure to do the following:

1. Assign yourself to an issue
2. **Make sure** you `git pull` the latest changes to the master branch
3. Checkout a new branch `git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]` to commit your changes to
4. Make (and test!) your changes.
5. `git commit -m "ADD A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CHANGES"` to commit your changes to the branch
6. `git push origin [name_of_your_branch]` to push your changes to the repo
7. Create a **Pull Request** into the master branch
8. After approval from **at least one** supervisor (**@leesw98** or **@michellehuh** or **@gauravnv**) merge branch into master.

## Running the server and website

To use the website, you need to run the server using this command in terminal after activating virtualenv:

`cd project_directory`

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

To use different databases, you can use the following command:

```bash
DJANGO_DATABASE=[insert_db_name] ./manage.py [COMMAND]
```

To be able parse data from csv files, you also need to run the rabbitmq server from terminal using this command:

```bash
celery -A reboot worker -l info
```

The command allows us to use multiple workers to run tasks.

## Git Hook

`cp hooks/* .git/hooks/`
